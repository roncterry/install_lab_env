-Updated the system_test_functions.sh file to better handle monolithic vs modulelar Libvirt daemon config ... again. Fixed all of the tests this time. ;-)
2024-12-04
-Added NetworkManager VLAN and bridge creation functions to helper_functions.sh and updated install_functions.sh and remove_functions.sh to see if either the wicked.service or NetworkManager.service is enabled and use the appropriate VLAN/bridge creation/removal methods.

-Updated the system_test_functions.sh file to better handle monolithic vs modulelar Libvirt daemon config
2024-04-23
-Updated and fixed error messages in install_functions.sh script
-Fixed error in helper_functions.sh with qemu (qemu-kvm) version checking
-Fixed errors in display output in helper_functions.sh for machine type checking
2023-10-06
-Updatad README.md file
-Added additional README markdown files for lab environment standards and libvirt requirements/best practices.
2023-09-07
-fixed bug in the backup_lab_env.sh and backup_vm.sh scripts with OVMF binary copying
2023-08-25
-updated the cpu model change function
2023-08-23
-fixed the test that looks for qemu-system-x86_64
2023-07026
-fixed the libvirt test to look for the service to be enabled vs active

-Added ability to backup and restore virtual TPM when backing up and installing VMs.
-Added backup_vm.sh script to backup individual VMs in the same manner as the backup_lab_env.sh script.
-Added functionality to backup_lab_env.sh to export a VM's XML config before it is backed up if doesn't exist in the VM's directory. Also added automatic updateing of the newly exported VM's config to make the changes to the <cpu> section (feature pcid) and lsilogic-->virtio-scsi if they aren't already done.
-Updated the install_lab_env.sh fuctions to make sure that the <cpu> section feature pcid line isn't lost if LIBVIRT_SET_CPU_TO_HYPERVISOR_DEFAULT=Y
-Rearranged the lab_env.cfg file into sections of similar config to make it easier to work with.

-Fixed bug in backup_lab_env.sh and backup_vm.sh to make sure nvram can get backed up
2021-11-11
-Reworked the nvram backup functions to copy the OVMF binary into the VM's directory and be more reliable (backup_lab_env.sh backup_vm.sh helper_functions.sh)
2021-11-15
-Added test for swtpm
2022-01-04
-added restore_vm.sh script to restore individual VMs in the smae manner as the install_lab_env.sh script (i.e. restore snapshots, restore TPM, update VM's xml config, etc).
-fixed bug in helper_functions.sh:edit_libvirt_domxml where the <cpu> tag was being editied with the wrong feature policy (cpuid-->(pcid)
2022-01011
-removed the code that changed the <cpu> tag stuff in the Libvirt VM's XML config reverting it back to the original behavior when LIBVIRT_SET_CPU_TO_HYPERVISOR_DEFAULT=Y (cpu feature named pcid needs to be set to optional not required so I dont' want to do that in a scripted manner)
