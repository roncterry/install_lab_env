#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    SECTION: Course Name/ID Configuration
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# This should be a short but descriptive name of the course lab environment
#
COURSE_NAME="My Test Course"


# This should be the course number
#
COURSE_NUM="TEST101"


#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#    SECTION: Test Requirements
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Which tests do you need to run on the lab machine to ensure it will work?
#
# A number of tests can be performed on the lab machine to ensure everthing
# required for the lab environment to run is present/enabled/configured. The
# default is for all tests to run, meaning that if not specifically set to 'N', 
# a test will run.
#
# The following are the currently available tests. Additional tests may be added
# in the future.  However, because the defualt behavior is to run a test
# unless specificaly told not to, a configuration file created for an earlier
# set of available tests should continue working when new tests are added.
# 
# REQUIRE_VT_ENABLED
#   This will check to make sure that VT is enabled in the BIOS. This is 
#   typically required if you are going to be using a hypervisor to run VMs in
#   the lab environment. 
#
#   This should probably be set to Y.
#
# REQUIRE_MIN_CPUS
#   This will check to make sure that the lab machine has enough CPUs as
#   specified in the MIN_CPUS variable later in this configuration file.
#
# REQUIRE_MIN_MEMORY
#   This will check to make sure that the lab machine has enough memory as
#   specified in the MIN_MEMORY variable later in this configuration file.
#
# REQUIRE_MIN_DISKSPACE
#   This will check to make sure that the lab machine has enough free disk space
#   as specified in the MIN_DISK_FREE variable later in this configuration file.
#
# REQUIRE_REGULAR_USER
#   This will check to make sure the current user is a regular user and not
#   the root user. 
#
#   This should always be set to Y unless you know for sure it should be N.
#
# REQUIRE_SUDO_NOPASSWD
#   This will check to make sure sudo is installed and the the current user has
#   ALL=(ALL) :NOPASSWD ALL set in the /ect/sudoers file.
#   This is more important than it seems becuase a greate deal of what this
#   script does requires root priviliges.
#
#   This should always be set to Y unless you know for sure it should be N.
#
# REQUIRE_P7ZIP
#   This checks to make sure the p7zip package (7z command) is installed. 
#   This is important because virtual machine archives in the student media are 
#   typically created using this utility.
#
#   It is safe to leave this set to Y.
#
# REQUIRE_KVM_VIRT
#   This checks to make sure the KVM kernel module is loaded and KVM is enabled.
#   The default hypervisor for SUSE lab evironments is KVM so this will in most
#   all cases be set to Y.
#
# REQUIRE_KVM_NESTED
#   This checks to make sure nested virtualization is enabled in the KVM
#   hypervisor. If your lab environment does not require nested virtualization,
#   you can set this to N. However, even if you do not require nested
#   virtualization it is safe to leave it set to Y.
#
# REQUIRE_QEMU_OVMF
#   This checks to make sure the qemu-ovmf-x86_64 package is installed.
#   This package is required if you have KVM VMs that boot using UEFI.
#   However, even if you do not have VMs that boot using UEFI it is safe to 
#   leave it set to Y.
#
# REQURE_LIBVIRT
#   This checks to make sure Libvirt is installed and configured to allow a
#   regular user to fully use Libvirt features (i.e. start/stop/define/undefine
#   VMS/virtual networks.etc.). If you are using KVM virtual machine this should
#   definitly be set to Y.
#
# REQUIRE_LIBVIRT_TCP_LISTEN
#   This checks to make sure Libvirt is listening via TCP with no authentication.
#   This can be required if you are having VMs talk to the Libvirt daemon for
#   things such as STONTIH fencing in a cluster or Virt-Manager in a VM that can
#   see and manage VMs on the host.
#   NOTE: This can be considered a security risk. If possible you should also
#         run a host firewall and allow only the networks you want to access
#         Libvirt and your VMs.
#
# REQUIRE_LIBVIRT_QEMU_VNC_SPICE_LISTEN
#   This checks to see if the Libvirt QEMU driver is allowing VNC and Spice 
#   connections from all public network interfaces. This can be required if you
#   are allowing Virt-manager running in a VM to access the graphical consoles
#   of your running VMs.
#   NOTE: This can be concidered a security risk. If possible you should also
#         run a host firewall and allow only the networks you want to access
#         graphical consoles of your VMs.
#
# REQUIRE_VIRTUALBMC
#   This checks to make sure the python-virtualbmc package (vbmc command) is 
#   installed. This is important when your virtual machines require a BMC
#   (IPMI) device.
#
#   When using the standard lab machine image it is safe to leave this set to Y.
#
# REQUIRE_OPENVSWITCH
#   This checks to make sure the openvswitch and openvswitch-ovn-* packages 
#   are installed. This is important when your lab environment requires 
#   Open vSwitch based virtual networks or OpenvSwitch based connectivity 
#   between lab machines in a multi-labmachine environment.
#
#   When using the standard lab machine image it is safe to leave this set to Y.
#
# REQUIRE_SWTPM
#   This checks to make sure the swtpm package (swtpm command) is 
#   installed. This is important when your virtual machines require a TPM
#   device.
#
#   When using the standard lab machine image it is safe to leave this set to Y.

# A space delimited list of Libvirt VMs
#
# VMs should exist in a single directory and contain the disk images and a

#
# The XML config file should be the same name as the directory + ".xml".
#
# These VMs shoud be archive (i.e. .7z) files of the directory with the 
# extension ".7x.xxx" It is assumed that the VM directories reside in 
# "/home/VMs". All paths to disk images should be relative to the VM 
# directory in that directory.
#
# The VMs listed in LIBVIRT_VM_LIST should be the names of the files without 
# the ".7z.xxx"
#
LIBVIRT_VM_LIST=""


# Create an initial snapshot of Libvirt VMs after they have been installed 
#
#  Creating an initial snapshot immedeatly after a VM has been installed allows for 
#  an initial revert point. 
#  Remember that Libvirt snapshot are now protable when using the installer framework
#  so the VM may already contain shapshots.
#
LIBVIRT_CREATE_INITIAL_SNAPSHOT=""


# Name to use for the initial VM snapshot if created 
#
# Name to use for the initial snapshot of the VMs if the 
# LIBVIRT_CREATE_INITIAL_SNAPSHOT is set to Y
#
LIBVIRT_INITIAL_SNAPSHOT_NAME=""


# A space delimited list of Libvirt VM names that should be started by 
# the installation script at the end of the lab environment install.
#
# These VMs should only be VMs that are listed in $LIBVIRT_VM_LIST.
#
LIBVIRT_START_VM_LIST=""


# Change the VM's config file to set the CPU to one of the following:
#  -the hypervisor default 
#  -host-passthrough
#  -host-model (with the pcid=optional feature)
#
# This can be useful if you are not sure which version of Libvirt created the 
# VM's config file or if the CPU the VM will be run on will support the version
# specified in the VM's config file.
# (Most usefull for VMs created with default values on host machines with newer
# CPUs but installed/run on host machines with older CPUs)
#
# LIBVIRT_SET_CPU_TO_HYPERVISOR_DEFAULT removed the <cpu> tag from the VM's
# xml config file effectivly setting it to whatever is defined as the default
# for the intance of Libvirt where the VM is running. Libvirt will automatically
# add its default <cpu> tag to the VM's config when it is defined.
#
# Setting this to 'y' can potentialy fix problems where the VM won't boot or
# it is getting a kernel panic. It will however do the wrong thing if the <cpu>
# tag is already set correctly. 
#
# LIBVIRT_SET_CPU_TO_HOST_PASSTHROUGH changes the existing <cpu> tag to use
# host-passthrough. This means that the virtual CPU(s) presented to the VM
# will exactly match the host CPUs. The downside to this mode is that the
# VM may be unmigrtable to other hosts even if the target host has the same
# CPU. The mode is less desirable than host-model.
#
# LIBVIRT_SET_CPU_TO_HOST_MODEL changes the existing <cpu> tag to use
# host-model. This will also add the feature pcid=optional to VM's config XML.
# The host-model CPU mode is essentially a shortcut to copying the host CPU 
# capabilities to the VM at runtime rather than hard coding them in the VM's 
# XML config. This allows the VM to migratable to a vhost with the same or 
# newer CPU. It also means the VM will get the optimized <cpu> block added for
# any vhost it runs on without having to manually update the <cpu> block.
#
# Enabling this will ensure that the VM will run optimally in situations where 
# nested virtualization is required (i.e. cloud platforms that run the lab 
# environments). FYI, the best practice is for the <cpu> section in the VM's 
# config XML to already be set to what this does.
#
# What should I use?
#  Safest: All set to "n" (use what is already defined in the VM's config XML)
#  Next safest: LIBVIRT_SET_CPU_TO_HOST_MODEL="y" (others set to "n")
#
# -----------------------IMPORTANT-----------------------------

#    SECTION: VirtualBMC Definitions
#-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Network for the virtual BMC devices
#
# This should be the name of one of your virtual networks/bridges defined
# in LIBVIRT_NETWORK_LIST or BRIDGE_LIST. If it is a Libvirt network then
# it must match the name of the bridge created by the Libvirt network.
#
# Note: 
#       You can also define the virtual BMC devices on a per VM basis by
#       creating a file in the VM's directory named <VM>.vbmc (where <VM>
#       matches the name of the VM). This file must contain this
#       variable (VIRTUAL_BMC_NETWORK) and the following variable
#       (VIRTUAL_BMC_LIST) with only values matching the prameters for

# Will the lab environment be spread accross multiple lab machines?
#
# If set to Y then the installation script will know that the VMs for the

# to N then all VMs for the lab environment will be on a single lab machine.
#
MULTI_LAB_MACHINE="N"


# Name extension added to VM configuration files when the lab environment
# is spread accross multiple lab machines.
#
# If the VMs in the lab environment are spread accross multiple lab machines
# (typically due to the lab machines not having enough RAM for them to be on
# a single  machine) then the pre-installed/configured VMs will need to have
# an alternate VM config file that defines a different virtual network
# configuration (i.e. VLANs+bridges instead of Libvirt virtual networks).
# This alternate VM config file should reside in the VM's directory along
# side the original VM config file and will need to be named in a specific
# way. The file name should be: <VM_NAME>-<MULTI_LM_EXT>.xml
#
# Example: single lab machine file name = admin.xml
#          multi lab machine file name =  admin-multi_lm.xml
#
# This variable is only used when MULTI_LAB_MACHINE=Y

#   Note: The physical device is the physical network device to attach to the
#         bridge. Note that a network device of any type (ethernet, wifi, etc)
#         can be listed. If the bridge should have no physical device attached
#         enter a - into the physical device field. 
#         If the physical device specified doesn't exist then a veth pair is
#         created with that name.
#
#   Note: The parent bridge field is used when creating a new bridge that
#         corresponds to a VLAN on an Open vSwitch bridge (i.e. a child bridge
#         on a VLAN tagged port on an existing bridge). 
#         The parent bridge should be the name of the Open vSwitch bridge to
#         create the VLAN port on.
#         This parent bridge must be listed in the OVS_BRIDGE_LIST variable
#         before the VLAN tagged bridge is listed. This must be used in 
#         conjunction with VLAN tag.
#         If the bridge is _not_ a VLAN bridge, enter a - into the
#         parent bridge field.
