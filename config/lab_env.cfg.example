# This should be a short but descriptive name of the course lab environment
#
COURSE_NAME="My Test Course"


# This should be the course number
#
COURSE_NUM="TEST101"


# Which tests do you need to run on the lab machine to ensure it will work?
#
# A number of tests can be performed on the lab machine to ensure everthing
# required for the lab environment to run is present/enabled/configured. The
# default is for all tests to run, meaning that if not specifically set to 'N', 
# a test will run.
#
# The following are the currently available tests. Additional tests may be added
# in the future.  However, because the defualt behavior is to run a test
# unless specificaly told not to, a configuration file created for an earlier
# set of available tests should continue working when new tests are added.
# 
# REQUIRE_VT_ENABLED
#   This will check to make sure that VT is enabled in the BIOS. This is 
#   typically required if you are going to be using a hypervisor to run VMs in
#   the lab environment. 
#
#   This should probably be set to Y.
#
# REQUIRE_MIN_MEMORY
#   This will check to make sure that the lab machine has enough memory as
#   specified in the MIN_MEMORY variable later in this configuration file.
#
# REQUIRE_MIN_DISKSPACE
#   This will check to make sure that the lab machine has enough free disk space
#   as specified in the MIN_DISK_FREE variable later in this configuration file.
#
# REQUIRE_SUDO_NOPASSWD
#   This will check to make sure sudo is installed and the the current user has
#   ALL=(ALL) :NOPASSWD ALL set in the /ect/sudoers file.
#   This is more important than it seems becuase a greate deal of what this
#   script does requires root priviliges.
#
#   This should always be set to Y unless you know for sure it should be N.
#
# REQUIRE_P7ZIP
#   This check to make sure the p7zip (7z command) is installed. This is
#   important because virtual machine archives in the student media are 
#   typically created using this utility.
#
#   It is safe to leave this set to Y.
#
# REQUIRE_KVM_VIRT
#   This checks to make sure the KVM kernel module is loaded and KVM is enabled.
#   The default hypervisor for SUSE lab evironments is KVM so this will in most
#   all cases be set to Y.
#
# REQUIRE_KVM_NESTED
#   This checks to make sure nested virtualization is enabled in the KVM
#   hypervisor. If your lab environment does not require nested virtualization,
#   you can set this to N. However, even if you do not require nested
#   virtualization it is safe to leave it set to Y.
#
# REQURE_LIBVIRT
#   This checks to make sure Libvirt is installed and configured to allow a
#   regular user to fully use Libvirt features (i.e. start/stop/define/undefine
#   VMS/virtual networks.etc.). If you are using KVM virtual machine this should
#   definitly be set to Y.
#
# REQUIRE_LIBVIRT_TCP_LISTEN
#   This checks to make sure Libvirt is listening via TCP with no authentication.
#   This can be required if you are having VMs talk to the Libvirt daemon for
#   things such as STONTIH fencing in a cluster or Virt-Manager in a VM that can
#   see and manage VMs on the host.
#   NOTE: This can be considered a security risk. If possible you should also
#         run a host firewall and allow only the networks you want to access
#         Libvirt and your VMs.
#
# REQUIRE_LIBVIRT_QEMU_VNC_SPICE_LISTEN
#   This checks to see if the Libvirt QEMU driver is allowing VNC and Spice 
#   connections from all public network interfaces. This can be required if you
#   are allowing Virt-manager running in a VM to access the graphical consoles
#   of your running VMs.
#   NOTE: This can be concidered a security risk. If possible you should also
#         run a host firewall and allow only the networks you want to access
#         graphical consoles of your VMs.

# Will the lab environment be spread accross multiple lab machines?
#
# If set to Y then the installation script will know that the VMs for the
# lab environment are going to be spread accross multiple lab machines. If set 
# to N then all VMs for the lab environment will be on a single lab machine.
#
MULTI_LAB_MACHINE="N"


# Name extension added to VM configuration files when the lab environment
# is spread accross multiple lab machines.
#
# If the VMs in the lab environment are spread accross multiple lab machines
# (typically due to the lab machines not having enough RAM for them to be on
# a single  machine) then the pre-installed/configured VMs will need to have
# an alternate VM config file that defines a different virtual network
# configuration (i.e. VLANs+bridges instead of Libvirt virtual networks).
# This alternate VM config file should reside in the VM's directory along
# side the original VM config file and will need to be named in a specific
# way. The file name should be: VM_NAME-MULTI_LM_EXT.xml
#
# Example: single lab machine file name = admin.xml
#          multi lab machine file name =  admin-multi_lm.xml
#
# This variable is only used when MULTI_LAB_MACHINE=Y
